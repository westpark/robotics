To run the "text robot": py -3 -mpiwars.controllers
To send commands: py -3 shell.py

CHALLENGES
==========

* Skittles: remote control; needs some kind of front "bumper" (ask Chus?)

* Line-follower: complex; needs a line-follower sensor which we don't have; might be able to use camera (which we don't have yet); the boys are more likely to get interested in this

* Pi Noon: remote control; need means of holding a wire (could be same bumper as for skittles)

* Obstacle course: remote-control

* Straight-line course: prefer autonomous; could be remote-control; use 2 sensors side-by-side to correct for swerve

* 3-point turn: either needs line-follower or use absolute distances; need to calibrate speed

* Proximity detector: autonomous; as per straight-line, need 2 sensors to allow for swerve

RESPONSIBILITIES
================

Steve: all remote-control -- Skittles; Pi Noon; Obstacle Course
Steve: calibrate speed/distance to feed into 3-point turn
Tim: Line-follower; straight-line; 3-point turn; Proximity
Tim: calibrate sensors so we can use them side-by-side
Tim: blog!
